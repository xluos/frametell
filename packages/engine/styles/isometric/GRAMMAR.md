# 从平面长出体积 · local renderer grammar

三个可见面，在同一投影下排成一列。

## Drawing contract

- Paper #EEF0F8; legible ink #302A4A. Palette names are literal: red is red, blue is blue, orange is orange. Keep a colour's meaning consistent across the film. Do not remap named colours to the order of a swatch.
- Surface: flat. The kit is a local implementation, with the source techniques identified in the provenance document.
- Only promise what the components below can draw. The hosted catalogue is a reference, not a complete implementation shipped in this fork.
- Use the style kit below to build the subject. It is automatically loaded for preview and export. Reuse one actor/object geometry across pages; move its layer, rather than redrawing it differently each time.

## Available components

- `P.isoBlock(x, y, w = 160, d = 160, h = 170, o = {})`: Anatomy orthographic extrusion with visible faces and depth shading. o: color,r,at.

## Motion, readability and review

- Tie each meaningful change to the spoken cue using P.c/P.cw. Show the actual transfer, assembly or state change; the spoken cause must be visible.
- Body text at least 36px, labels at least 28px. Keep actors, labels and any camera move within x=180..1740, y=220..880 in landscape. Leave the subtitle area clear. Verify camera crops as well as the static layout.
- Colours, material, recurring actor shape, the mechanism, cropping, overlap, subtitles and deterministic seeking are separate review assertions. Passing a layout check alone does not verify the style.
- Use 45/90-degree bends for metro routes; one continuous stroke for one-line; integer counts with stated units for isotype; real projection and face shading for isometric/instrument/inked. Use only constraints relevant to this style.
- Keep any unsupported visual request explicit in the storyboard and author the missing capability before rendering. A hosted poster or hover clip cannot substitute for a local sample.
